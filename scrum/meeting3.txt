Updates from team to report:
    - Frontend: routes: / /login /details
    - Backend: routes for users
    - Database: Pull data and store locally (issue with async), parsing ideas
    - Algorithm ideas: clustering/classification

Questions from us:
    * Async()
    * Inconsistencies in db [Discussed with Diran -> he will go in and update & fix in the next couple days]
        - Ingredients in recipes do not match (ex: "small orange", "powdered sugar, divided")
        - Ingredients separation
        - Format of Ingredient data (1/2, etc)
        - "costPerIngredients" vs "costPerIngredient"
        * Ideally, we want a small sample set to test on for now. 
    * Need not consider on a weekly basis: Salt, Pepper, Cooking Oil (?)


Questions from client: Nope :))


Next Steps: ALGORITHM, MVP
    ALGORITHM: 
        - parse the data
        - data-structures to store data & compute
        - flush out ideas for algorithm
            - come up with a plan that imcorportates and significantly utilizes each parameter
            - recommend meals & produce grocery list
            - Budget, Group Size, Dietary Restrictions

    DATABASE: 
        - Be able to store data locally
        - Parse data into usable format using costPerIngredients (-> Ideally store it in firebase)

    UI:
        - Make progress on frontend
        - Update and add to backend routes


Important Notes to Keep in Mind (cumulated relevant from previous meetings): 
    * We need to explore how each of the parameters for recommending meals fits into the algorithm.
        Inputs: Budget, Group Size, Dietary Restrictions
            Budget: Size of the ingredients
            Family Size <-> Serving Size (1-to-1)
        Look at the budget -> ingredients required -> []
    * How strict should our recommendations follow their parameters?
        Would you be willing to sacrifice accuracy?
            3 each day for a week (1 Breakfast, 1 Lunch, 1 Dinner per day)
        Recommend good recipes over reducing food waste?
            Recipes overlap -> HIGH IMPORTANCE
    * What format would you like the recommendations to be in?
        - ingredients list [Grocery list + bill]
        - recipes
