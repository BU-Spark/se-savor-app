Updates from team to report:
    - Demonstrated express backend hitting Cloud Firestore db.

Updates from client: 
    - grocery list wirefram will be up by mid-March

Questions from us:
    * We need to explore how each of the parameters for recommending meals fits into the algorithm.
        Inputs: Budget, Group Size, Dietary Restrictions
            Budget: Size of the ingredients
            Family Size <-> Serving Size (1-to-1)
        Look at the budget -> ingredients required -> []
    * How strict should our recommendations follow their parameters?
        Would you be willing to sacrifice accuracy?
            3 each day for a week (1 Breakfast, 1 Lunch, 1 Dinner per day)
        Recommend good recipes over reducing food waste?
            Recipes overlap -> HIGH IMPORTANCE
    * What format would you like the recommendations to be in?
        - ingredients list [Grocery list + bill]
        - recipes

Questions from client: Nope :))


Next Steps: ALGORITHM, MVP
    ALGORITHM: 
        - parse the data
        - data-structures to store data & compute
        - initial algorithm planning
            - come up with a plan that imcorportates and significantly utilizes each parameter
