    Gather requirements for algorithm to recommend meals and produce a grocery list
    Based off the following parameters:
        Budget

Is the team having any issues?
    We need to explore how each of the parameters for recommending meals fits into the algorithm.
    How strict should our recommendations follow their parameters?
        Would you be willing to sacrifice accuracy?
        Recommend good recipes over reducing food waste?
    What format would you like the recommendations to be in?
